Associate interactive transcripts with your audiovisual content and make your media more accessible to people and search engines.

== Description ==

The Hyperaudio Wordpress Plugin allows you to import and convert data from a number of popular speech-to-text providers and tools. The result is an interactive transcript where words "light up" as they are spoken. Clicking on words in a transcript takes you directly to equivalent part of your media, while selecting a passage of text creates a handy link back to the highlighted part – great for sharing!

Currently the transcript generator (provided in the settings) can convert from the following speech-to-text outputs:

* OpenEditor JSON
* Speechmatics JSON
* Google Speech-to-text JSON
* LowerQuality Gentle
* SRT formatted captions

Two views of the resultant transcript are provided:

== Hypertranscript View ==

A Hypertranscript is an HTML representation of a media file's spoken audio. This format is ready to be pasted between the Hyperaudio shortcode. Note that since Hypertranscripts create timings and HTML is a format that is both human and machine readable, timings and words can be tweaked by editing this HTML.

== Rendered View ==

The rendered view is how the text itself will look once viewed as an Interactive Transcript. Words can be editeed from the rendered view but timings of words may not be maintained if you (say) replace two words with one, or paste content into the text.

Once you are happy with your text you need to locate your source media and you're ready to create an Interactive Transcript within your post using the `[hyperaudio]` shortcode.

Something like this :

```
[hyperaudio src="link-to-media.mp4"]

As well as native mp4 and mp3 files.

== Captions ==

The plugin also creates captions for your videos. Useful when viewing content in fullscreen.

== Accessibility ==

All in all the Hyperaudio Wordpress plugin makes audiovisual media more accessible. Accessible to those with hearing diffuculties or people consuming content which is not neccessarily in their first language. Accessible to those choosing to view content with the audio off. Accessible to search engines so that content can be indexed and more easily discovered.

== Frequently Asked Questions

= How do I produce the transcript data? =

The easiest way is probably to use the Hyperaudio Lite Editor.
Alternatively you can use the OpenEditor (transcript editor) which you can find on GitHub.
Or you can use Google Speech-to-Text Service, Speechmatics or Gentle's aligner (especially if you already have the transcript and just want the timings)
